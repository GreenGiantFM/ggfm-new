It’s the start of a new term, with new faces, new shows, and the same good ol’ sound from Green Giant FM! It’s been quite a while since we last saw you, and a bunch of shows have been making headlines since. We’ve all heard about the success of Squid Game, Midnight Mass, WandaVision, and even the newest season of Sex Education, but are they really worth the hype?

Grab a bucket of your favorite popcorn, dim your lights, and make yourself comfortable. Join DJs Joaquin, Cora, Dana, and Phey, as they discuss the hype surrounding the latest and biggest shows around in a brand new episode of The Reel Deal!

Don’t miss out! Tune in through our socials on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube!
