Boil up the cauldrons and ready the brooms as we get magical with the world of witchcraft!

Take a step back and understand the history of witchcraft and the stereotypes behind them. What's with the black cats, weird potions, and pointy hats? Maybe DJs Alfie, Chachu, Riddle, and Tony have the answers on the brand new episode of Mystery Box so get your robes on and prepare for an anti-witch guide in case you get cursed!

Uncover the mysteries by tuning in through our socials on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube!
