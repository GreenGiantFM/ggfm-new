Climate change is a global issue that we have been facing for many decades now that only gets worse due to years of inaction and negligence. To battle this, collective effort and sharing knowledge is needed to bring to light a specific solution that fits our circumstances. Be part of the change and join the fight against climate change in the 13th Young Economists’ International Convention: Actualizing Climate Ambitions in the Developing World: Redefining the Path Towards a Sustainable Future.

This convention aims to highlight the looming threat of climate change and the mitigation measures that we could employ. Through a series of talks and panel discussions with the esteemed speakers, the event intends to make the participants realize the magnitude of this problem and learn from these to be part of the change.

On June 4, 2022 from 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM, the event would be fractioned into two sessions. The morning session, with the theme Effective Mitigation Amidst Global Environmental Externalities, is filled with renowned speakers and panelists that will discuss the climate policies and the feasibility of pursuing carbon-neutrality in the Philippines. The afternoon session, with the theme Necessary Adaptations for the Looming Impacts of Climate Change, is packed with distinguished speakers and panelists that will talk about economic and climate opportunities and envision modernized agriculture.
