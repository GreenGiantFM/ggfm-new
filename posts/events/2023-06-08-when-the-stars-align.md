**About DLSU Chorale**

De La Salle University Chorale, founded in 1975, is the official chorale group of De La Salle University. Through the years, DLSU Chorale has made a mark in the history of the choral arts, winning various prestigious awards. Under the tutelage of Mr. Noel Bugarin, the group carved a niche in the music scene both locally and abroad. In 1995, under the guidance of Prof. Rodolfo Delarmente, the group embarked on a highly successful European concert tour, reaping accolades from Filipino and European audiences.

Most recently, the group garnered the Gold and the Grand Prize in the Asia Pacific Arts Festival 2019 held in Vietnam under the tutelage of their current conductor, Mr. Jose Emmanuel Aquino, with whom DLSU Chorale envisions to raise the bar of Lasallian excellence in the arts through its highly competent and world-class peformances.

The concert wil showcase the various solistic and small ensemble abilities of the members as they sing music from different genres, periods, and styles while still featuring a full program for the whole Chorale. The group wants to show that DLSU Chorale is not just a group of singers, but a group of soloists who sound good together.

Additionally, this production is an effort to raise funds for DLSU Chorale's plans to join competitions this year, such as NAMCYA, Andrea O. Veneracion International Choral Competition, and Busan Choral Festival & Competition.
