**Get ready to level up your summer with CONQuest 2023, the biggest gaming and pop culture convention of the year!**

CONQuest 2023 is taking over Manila and bringing you the ultimate gaming and pop culture experience from June 2 to June 4, 2023. The convention will last for three whole days at various venues such as SMX Manila, Conrad Manila, Mall of Asia (MoA), Seashell Lane, and National University MoA (NU MoA). Unleash your inner geek with the action-packed activities happening throughout the event!

Take a nostalgic trip down memory lane and relive the golden age of gaming with a wide selection of retro arcade machines and endless opportunities for free play fun at the Freeplay and Retro Arcade. When you’re done meddling with the past, take a step into the future in the Indiezone and view the showcases of independent game developers and their groundbreaking creations. Watch your favorite content creators and celebrities battle it out and livestream in the Alliance Games Finals, Celebrity Showdown, and the Streamzone. If you’re more into card games, CONQuest has you covered with their Tabletop and TCG activity. Gather your friends and enjoy some tabletop fun or engage in intense trading card battles for unforgettable gaming experiences. 

If you’re not that into gaming, don’t worry! Jam all night long to your favorite songs and let the rhythm take control as you groove to the beats of the best local musicians and bands at Music Night. You can also immerse yourself in a visual feast in the Art Gallery where talented artists showcase their stunning and eye-catching creations. Get a chance to meet your favorite content creators, celebrities, and gaming icons as you meet them face-to-face during the Meet and Greets. Don’t forget to take a walk through the Quest Market so you can bring home some amazing collectibles and merchandise! And if you get too caught up in all this fun, you can refuel and recharge with the delicious delights at the Food Festival.
