The UP Statistical Society (UP StatSoc) is a duly-recognized student academic organization for statistics majors in the University of the Philippines - Diliman. Founded in 1981, UP StatSoc has been a pioneer in promoting awareness and enhancing interest in the field of Statistics in the university and beyond.

After holding three successful editions of the largest student-run conference on Statistics in the country, UP StatSoc is elated to announce that **LIMITLESS 2022: National Youth Summit in Statistics** returns this June with the theme “_Diving Deep Into Data_”. For the first time, LIMITLESS will be conducted entirely online via Zoom and streaming on Facebook Live for the benefit of high school students, college students, and young professionals all over the Philippines.

The two-day summit will tackle various fields of application in Statistics, which will enrich the participants’ understanding of its value and scope, and inform them of their potential career paths in the field of Statistics. The conference will feature **keynote talks** on big data and the misinterpretation of Statistics, a **workshop** on data analysis and visualization using R and RStudio, and **breakout sessions** from renowned people in six fields of Statistics: data science and analytics, actuarial science, social statistics, machine learning, biostatistics, and banking and finance. Through these activities, participants will gain new technical skills and knowledge on Statistics that will aid them in their future career as Statistics practitioners.

LIMITLESS will also feature activities that will raise awareness to the importance of Statistics to the general public. In collaboration with Pulse, UP StatSoc’s infographics initiative, select research papers from high school students, undergraduates, and alumni will be showcased through **online** **infographics** to demonstrate the use of statistical techniques and analysis to solve real-life problems. **ASCENT, a** **data presentation and visualization competition,** will also be held to hone participants’ skills in turning Statistics into useful information that can be communicated to a wider audience, and to demonstrate how Statistics can tell compelling stories. Participants will get a chance to win cash prizes, along with a license and membership grants from the trusted online learning platform, DataCamp, and the acclaimed organization, the Analytics Association of the Philippines! LIMITLESS will also host UP StatSoc’s very own quiz show, **Stat-en-Ekek**, where everyone can have fun while testing their knowledge about anything and everything under the sun!

LIMITLESS is happening **on June 18 and 25, 2022**, from **3:00 to 6:00 PM_._** Register for free at: [https://tinyurl.com/Limitless2022RegForm](https://tinyurl.com/Limitless2022RegForm "https://tinyurl.com/Limitless2022RegForm").
