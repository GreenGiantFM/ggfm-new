**Medical Mission 2023: Through Passion with Purpose**
ENGLICOM’s Medical Mission 2023: Through Passion with Purpose aspires to provide quality healthcare to their beneficiary funded by a fun run that promotes physical well-being. The two-day event will have two anticipated parts, Medical Mission Proper and Fundraising Activity.

**Medical Mission Proper**
The first part of the event, the Medical Mission Proper, will be held on July 16, 2023, at Saint Anthony de Padua Chapel, Banga 1st, Plaridel, Bulacan. It will start at 9:30 AM and end at 4:05 PM. The Medical Mission Proper aims to promote health awareness and provide healthcare services to the beneficiary. A seminar will be held to further enhance one’s literacy in health education and increase overall consciousness of one’s health. Dental and general medical consultations will also be offered. Additionally, nutrition and hygiene goods will be disseminated to recipients.

**Fundraising Activity: Fun Run**
The second part of the event, the Fundraising Activity, is a fun run that will be held on July 30, 2023, at Ayala Malls Arca South. It will start as early as 5:00 AM and it will end at 1:00 PM. The activity intends to encourage the community to support the Medical Mission Proper. In line with this, the Fundraising Activity also motivates them to live a healthy lifestyle through the fun run. The fun run serves as an avenue for health and fun, as it includes a bubble run and bubble rave. Furthermore, there will be sales and concessionaires that will also aid in the raising of funds for the Medical Mission Proper. These concessionaires will offer a variety of goods such as snacks and beverages at the leisure of participants.
