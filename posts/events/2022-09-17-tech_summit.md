**_A decade of innovation: Reimagining our world in tech with Technology Summit 2022_**

By Criscela Ysabelle Racelis

For all individuals, tech-savvy or not, DLSU Technology Summit is back to expose its
audience to cutting-edge technology that will shape our futures. Now on its 10th year, the
event will feature ten informative talks: all free of charge.

Two years into the pandemic, we have grown more reliant than ever on technology. Trends come and go, but in a world where the new normal requires physical distancing, tech is here to stay and keep us connected—and as innovation continues to happen at a fast pace, it becomes all the more important to make sure no one gets left behind.

This is what DLSU Technology Summit stands for: inviting people from all walks of life, be they students or professionals, to come and experience the newest developments in technology that will leave lasting impacts not only on our futures but also on that of the generations to come.

Held by La Salle Computer Society, a professional organization under the College of Computer Studies and accredited by the Council of Student Organizations, Technology Summit 2022 stays true to the event’s legacy of introducing society to the peak of technological innovation.

Celebrating its 10th anniversary, Technology Summit 2022 invites all learners to join in and reimagine our world in tech.

**Daunting Technologies: Interactive AI and Cyberwarfare**
With great computing power comes great responsibility, and two core fields have long been the
center of concern for just how much power tech can hold—artificial intelligence, and
cyberwarfare. Through these talks, attendees will learn about not only its strengths and potential
but also the risks and threats they pose—along with how they can be used for good.

**Field Advancements: Tech for the Space and the Environment**
Technology might be capable of creating new worlds in cyberspace, but it is also integral to
exploring and preserving the world that already exists around us. Technology Summit 2022
wishes to emphasize to its participants just how much potential technology has in terms of
uncovering the unknown realm of space and caring for our earth.

**Powerful Technologies: Computing Processors and Big Data** Decades ago, computers were only accessible to professionals. But in our day and age where technological devices are a necessity, the world is pushing the boundaries not only of industrial-level technology, but also the tech that we have at our fingertips. The event invites participants to discover the newest upgrades in terms of our personal computing processors, as well as the use of our online data.

**Gaming Technologies: eSports**
With the popularity of eSports and online games constantly on the rise, it’s safe to say that these
will be a staple not only in our hobbies and interests but also in professional-level competition.
Find out more about eSports through Technology Summit 2022.

**Machine Learning: Automated Fact Checking** The widening accessibility of the internet also implies a greater risk of spreading false information and misconceptions. Discover how cutting-edge machine learning technology can aid us in combating the spread of fake news.

**Future Vision: Exploring the Metaverse and Cryptocurrency** Lastly, throughout the past few years, blockchain technology has continuously been a hot topic. Yet, in spite of all the attention around it, it remains unclear to many people how exactly this will help us, or affect our world. Put on your future vision goggles and traverse the horizon of our ever-expanding web.

Technology Summit 2022 will be held entirely online, via **Zoom and Facebook Live**, with its first day on Saturday, **September 24, 2022**, from **1:00 PM to 6:15 PM**, and its second day on Saturday, October 1, happening at the same timeslot. Certificates will be provided to all attendees, and raffle prizes will also be given out to lucky ambassadors and participants.
