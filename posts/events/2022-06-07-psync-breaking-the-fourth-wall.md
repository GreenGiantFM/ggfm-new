Better hold that glass with two hands, ‘cause something’s breaking soon!

De La Salle University’s Samahan ng mga Mag-aaral sa Sikolohiya (SMS) proudly presents the return of its annual national psychology conference “**PSYnc**” with the theme of “**Breaking the Fourth Wall**”.

**PSYnc: Breaking the Fourth Wall** aims to integrate psychological ideas on inspiring others on how one can make a difference, small or big, which begins with knowing oneself as a foundation to finding one’s strengths and purpose in life. It also strives to pave the way for a space where individuals can feel empowered and inspired in hopes that they develop and grow to be the next generation of leaders.

Not only is this a chance to learn academically, the conference is also jampacked with various recreational activities where you can engage and interact with Psychology students and enthusiasts from within and outside De La Salle University.

Following last year’s success with event centered towards the application of Positive Psychology in the midsts of adversity, this year’s conference aims to focus on the application of **Humanistic Psychology** or the school of psychology that emphasizes the wholeness of an individual who is capable of achieving free will, freedom, personal growth, and change as they journey through different experiences such as love, grief, pain, and joy.

The annual conference will span over three days from June 16-18, 2022 and will feature a movie night, three webinars on Humanistic Psychology, and an open-mic night to close off the festivities which will be held via a Private Facebook Group, Zoom, and Discord.
