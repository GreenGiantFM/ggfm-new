**About AIESEC Chpater: De La Salle University - Manila**

Since 1980, AIESEC in DLSU-M has been developing passionate and competent Filipino leaders for future generations, all from our corner of Taft Avenue. Recognized by the Council of Student Organizations in DLSU, we are currently considered one of the top performing branches of AIESEC in the Philippines today.

We are a global youth-led NGO striving to achieve peace and fulfillment of humankind’s potential by activating leadership qualities in youth through learning from practical experiences in challenging environments.
